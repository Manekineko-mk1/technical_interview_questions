### LeetCode Problem: Two Sum

#### A. Possible Clarification Questions:
1. Are there any constraints on the space complexity of the solution?
2. Can the input array contain duplicate numbers?
3. Should the function return the indices in any specific order?

#### B. Concise Solution Intuition:
The goal is to find two numbers that add up to a given target. Using a hash map allows us to store each number's complement (the number needed to reach the target when added to it) and its index as we iterate through the array. If we find a number in the hash map that complements the current number, we can immediately return the indices of these two numbers as the solution.

#### C. Identify Edge Cases:
1. An array with only two elements (should return the indices of both if they add up to the target).
2. Multiple pairs sum up to the target (only one solution is needed, as per the problem constraints).
3. Negative numbers and a zero which could sum to a positive target.
4. Large numbers that could potentially cause integer overflow in other programming scenarios (not a concern in Python but could be in other languages).

#### D. Solution Code:
**Java Solution:**
```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> numMap = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (numMap.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {numMap.get(complement), i};
        }
        numMap.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
}
```

**Python Solution:**
```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_to_index = {}
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_to_index:
            return [num_to_index[complement], index]
        num_to_index[num] = index
    return []
```

#### E. Test Cases (Concise Verbal on How to Test):
1. Test with the smallest array size possible (e.g., [3,3], target=6).
2. Test with negative numbers (e.g., [-1, -2, -3, 4], target=1).
3. Test with an array containing zeros and positive numbers (e.g., [0, 4, 3, 0], target=0).
4. Test with no possible solution (should handle gracefully).

#### F. Test Cases Code:
**Java Test Cases:**
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] test1 = new int[]{2, 7, 11, 15};
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(twoSum(test1, 9))); // Output: [0, 1]

    int[] test2 = new int[]{3, 3};
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(twoSum(test2, 6))); // Output: [0, 1]

    int[] test3 = new int[]{-1, -2, -3, 4};
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(twoSum(test3, 1))); // Output: [2, 3]
}
```

**Python Test Cases:**
```python
print(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
print(twoSum([3, 3], 6))  # Output: [0, 1]
print(twoSum([-1, -2, -3, 4], 1))  # Output: [2, 3]
```

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios to ensure that the solution handles different array compositions and target values effectively. Would you like to explore more problems or need further details on any specific aspect?
