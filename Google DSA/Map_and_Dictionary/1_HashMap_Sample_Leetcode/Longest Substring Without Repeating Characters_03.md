### LeetCode Problem 3: "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

### Solution Approach
We can use a sliding window technique with two pointers to solve this problem efficiently.

#### A. Possible Clarification Questions
1. Should we consider case sensitivity in the substring? (Assume yes, based on typical string problems.)
2. How should the function handle an empty string input? (Return 0.)

#### B. Concise Solution Intuition
Use a sliding window approach with a hash set or hash map to track the characters in the current window:
- Expand the right pointer to explore new characters.
- If a character repeats (found in the set/map), contract the window from the left until the repeated character is removed.
- Keep track of the maximum window size found during the process.

#### C. Identify Edge Cases
1. The entire string is unique.
2. The string contains all identical characters.
3. The string contains a mix of repeating and non-repeating patterns.
4. The string is empty.

#### D. Solution Code
**Java Solution:**
```java
public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int maxLength = 0, i = 0, j = 0;

        while (j < s.length()) {
            if (!set.contains(s.charAt(j))) {
                set.add(s.charAt(j++));
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, j - i);
            } else {
                set.remove(s.charAt(i++));
            }
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

**Python Solution:**
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        charSet = set()
        l = 0
        maxLength = 0
        
        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in charSet:
                charSet.remove(s[l])
                l += 1
            charSet.add(s[r])
            maxLength = max(maxLength, r - l + 1)
        
        return maxLength
```

#### E. Test Cases (Concise Verbal on How to Test)
1. Test with a string where no characters repeat.
2. Test with a string where all characters are the same.
3. Test with an empty string.
4. Test with a string that includes a variety of character types (letters, digits, symbols).

#### F. Test Cases Code
**Java Test Code:**
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    System.out.println(solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcabcbb"));  // Output: 3
    System.out.println(solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("bbbbb"));     // Output: 1
    System.out.println(solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring(""));          // Output: 0
    System.out.println(solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("pwwkew"));    // Output: 3
}
```

**Python Test Code:**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solution = Solution()
    print(solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcabcbb"))  # Output: 3
    print(solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("bbbbb"))     # Output: 1
    print(solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring(""))          # Output: 0
    print(solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("pwwkew"))    # Output: 3
```

This sliding window approach ensures that the solution efficiently finds the longest substring without repeating characters by dynamically adjusting the window to exclude repeating elements. If you need further clarification or additional details, feel free to ask!
